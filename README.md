## Testing

The project includes both unit tests and end-to-end (E2E) tests.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests are implemented using Vitest and React Testing Library. They test individual components and contexts to ensure they work as expected in isolation.

To run the unit tests:

```bash
# Run tests once
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### End-to-End Tests

E2E tests are implemented using Cypress. They simulate real user interactions with the application to ensure the entire flow works as expected.

To run the E2E tests:

```bash
# Open Cypress test runner
npm run test:e2e

# Run E2E tests in headless mode
npm run test:e2e:headless
```
