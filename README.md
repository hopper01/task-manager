ðŸš€ **Live Demo**: [https://task-manager-sigma-self.vercel.app/](https://task-manager-sigma-self.vercel.app/)

## Features

- **Dashboard**: View upcoming, overdue, and completed tasks
- **Task Management**: Add, edit, and delete tasks
- **Priority Levels**: Set task priorities (High, Medium, Low)
- **Search and Filter**: Find and filter tasks easily
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between dark and light themes
- **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design works on all devices
- **Local Storage**: Task data persists in browser storage

## Testing

The project includes both unit tests and end-to-end (E2E) tests.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests are implemented using Vitest and React Testing Library. They test individual components and contexts to ensure they work as expected in isolation.

To run the unit tests:

```bash
# Run tests once
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### End-to-End Tests

E2E tests are implemented using Cypress. They simulate real user interactions with the application to ensure the entire flow works as expected.

To run the E2E tests:

```bash
# Open Cypress test runner
npm run test:e2e

# Run E2E tests in headless mode
npm run test:e2e:headless

# Run E2E tests against production
npm run test:e2e:prod
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment.

### Workflow Steps

1. **Build and Test**: Builds the application and runs unit tests on multiple Node.js versions
2. **End-to-End Tests**: Runs E2E tests against the production environment for the main branch
3. **Deployment**: Automatically deploys to Vercel when changes are pushed to the main branch

The CI/CD pipeline ensures that:
- All code changes are built successfully
- Unit tests pass before deployment
- Production E2E tests validate the live application
- Deployment is automated for the main branch

## Deployment on Vercel

The application is currently deployed on Vercel: [https://task-manager-sigma-self.vercel.app/](https://task-manager-sigma-self.vercel.app/)
